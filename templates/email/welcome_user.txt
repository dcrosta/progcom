Welcome to PyGotham Program Committee Talk Review!

During the public voting portion of the PyGotham selection process, we ask
prospective attendees to help review the many proposals we have received. While
there are many criteria that go into making a great PyGotham talk, what we want
to learn now is simple: based on the information in the proposal, would you like
to see the talk described at PyGotham in October?

The talk review web site will ask you to assess this question on a 3 point
scale, where "+1" means "I would definitely like to see this talk"; "0" means "I
have no preference"; and "-1" means "I do not think this talk should be in
PyGotham". Please note that you must click "Save Vote" in order for your vote to
be counted.

The talk review web site will present talks you have not yet voted on to you in
random order. You may rate as many or as few talks as you like, and you may skip
any talks you do not wish to rate.

When you're ready to get started, please log in at https://vote.pygotham.org/.

Thank you so much for your help in making this year's PyGotham program--we can't
do it without your time and thoughtful input. We hope you have fun reading these
talk proposals!
