Welcome to PyGotham Program Committee Talk Review!

During the public voting portion of the PyGotham selection process, we ask
prospective attendees to help review the many proposals we have received.
Community interest is a critical factor in assembling a great conference, and
that is primarily what we want to do with public voting: find out what talks
*you* want to see.

This year we are using a revised voting system that we hope will simplify the
process. Rather than voting on an abstract points scale, we have provided
options to indicate your level of interest described in english. We hope that
this will lead to a simpler and more consistent set of reviews. We have also
added a free-form text field in which you can explain your choice or give
feedback to the program committe. Please use it!

Please note that you must click "Save Vote" in order for your vote to be
counted.

We have also added a way for you to report talks which you feel may violate the
PyGotham Code of Conduct [1]. We will do everything within our power to ensure
that talks that could pose Code of Conduct violations won't even make it as far
as voting, but we may miss something. Please only use this rating for true Code
of Conduct issues.

The talk review web site will present you with talks in random order, omitting
the ones you have already voted on. You may rate as many or as few talks as you
like, and you may skip any talks you do not wish to rate.

When you're ready to get started, please log in at https://vote.pygotham.org/.

Thank you so much for your help in making this year's PyGotham program -- we
can't do it without your time and thoughtful input. We hope you have fun reading
these talk proposals!
